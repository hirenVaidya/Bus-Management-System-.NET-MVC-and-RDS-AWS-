Description:
The Bus Management System is a comprehensive web application developed using ASP.NET Core MVC and Identity for user authentication and authorization. This system is designed to streamline and simplify bus operations, including booking management and client information tracking.

Key Features:

User Authentication and Authorization: The system utilizes ASP.NET Core Identity to provide secure user authentication and authorization. Users can sign up, log in, and access the system based on their roles and permissions.

Client Details Management: The application allows administrators to manage client information efficiently. This includes recording client details such as name, email, and phone number, providing a comprehensive client database for improved customer service and communication.

Bus Information Management: The system enables the management of buses, including details such as bus name, bus type, seat layout (seat columns and rows), and the bus's origin and destination points. This feature assists in organizing and tracking bus schedules and availability.

. 

Database Integration: The project utilizes SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) as the relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing and managing data securely. This ensures data integrity and efficient data retrieval for the entire application.

Technology Stack:

ASP.NET Core MVC: The application is built on the ASP.NET Core framework, providing a robust and scalable web development platform.

ASP.NET Identity: ASP.NET Core Identity is used for user authentication and role-based authorization.

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): The RDS (Relational Database Service) in SSMS is employed to store and manage data related to clients, buses, bookings, and other relevant information.

Benefits:

The Bus Management System streamlines bus operations, enhances client management, and improves overall efficiency. It simplifies the booking process for customers while providing administrators with the tools to manage buses, routes, and client information effectively. By leveraging ASP.NET Core MVC and Identity, along with a secure database infrastructure, this system ensures data security and reliability.

This project aims to improve the bus management process, ultimately leading to better customer experiences and more efficient operations.
